# Forest-fire-detection
The Forest Fire Detection System leverages advanced technologies such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image processing to identify and monitor forest fires. The system is designed to analyze visual data (images or video) from cameras or drones in real-time, accurately detecting the presence of fire or smoke.
